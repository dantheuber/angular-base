#angular-base
A simple project from which angular projects can be started.

##Install Dependencies
This project uses `gulp` and `jspm`, as well as `compass` to make your development life easier. So you will need to install the necessary dependencies via the following commands:
```shell
#Install global commands used by gulp
sudo npm install -g gulp jspm jspm-bower-endpoint
#Setup jspm bower endpoint
jspm registry create bower jspm-bower-endpoint
#Install local node modules
npm install
```


##Start Working
Run `gulp host` to bundle the application and host it on `localhost:5003`
